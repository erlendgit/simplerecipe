== What to expect as developer ===

Though it's sad that not everything is (unit)testable, discover that the core of module development, the
heart of what makes your craft worth persuing, the true 'custom code' is surprisingly well testable. The
less easy to test parts of the code or 'drupal integration' has it's own measure of challenge. It reminds
us that there is more then TDD. Jet it is not less fun, and not just painfull.
